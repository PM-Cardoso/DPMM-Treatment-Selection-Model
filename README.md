# DPMM: Treatment Selection Model
This repository includes the code and sample dataset required to make predictions and fit a treatment selection model augmented with a Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM). The DPMM enables the ability to fit models and make predictions in the presence of missing values (assuming these are missing completely at random or missing at random).
